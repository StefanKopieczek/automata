automata
========

Library for easily creating and visualising cellular automata, such as Conway's Game of Life.

Preset automata:
 - GameOfLife
 - GameOfZombies (Game of life with less death by overcrowding, but more zombies!)
 - GameOfEarth (Simulation of the interaction of magma which forms land, and the sea - which erodes it. Not realistic in any way!)
 - GameOfAnts (Langton's Ant) 
 
 Controls:
  - Pan using arrow keys
  - Zoom using +/-
